Welcome to the Porter Community repo!

# Porter

Package your application artifact, client tools, configuration and deployment
logic together as a versioned bundle that you can distribute, and then install
with a single command. Based on the Cloud Native Application Bundle
Specification, [CNAB](https://deislabs.io/cnab), Porter provides a declarative
authoring experience that lets you focus on what you know best: your
application.

# Contact

* [Mailing List] - Great for following the project at a high level because it is low traffic, mostly release notes and blog posts on new features.
* [Slack] - Discuss #porter or #cnab with other users and the maintainers.
* [Open an Issue] - If you have a bug, feature request or question about Porter, ask on GitHub so that we can prioritize it and make sure you get an answer. If you ask on Slack, we will probably turn around and make an issue anyway. 😉

# Roadmap

Porter is an open-source project and things get done as quickly as we have
motivated contributors working on features that interest them. 😉

We use a single [project board][board] across all of our repositories to track
open issues and pull requests.

The roadmap represents what the core maintainers have said that they are
currently working on and plan to work on over the next few months. We use the
"on-hold" bucket to communicate items of interest that doesn't have a core
maintainer who will be working on it.
